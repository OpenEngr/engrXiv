We've tried to make our finances as transparent as possible. Thus you can view our ledger of income and expenses on our [financials page](http://blog.engrxiv.org/financials/). Our regularly occurring monthly expenses total $338 which includes domain registrations and the SSL certificate as well as development and maintenance costs to host the server. Income beyond these fixed costs would go towards marketing and community building efforts.
