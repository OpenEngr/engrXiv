We've tried to make our finances as transparent as possible. Thus you can view our ledger of income and expenses on our [financials page](http://blog.engrxiv.org/financials/). Currently our regularly occurring monthly expenses total a modest $4.61 which includes domain registrations and the SSL certificate. Income beyond these fixed costs would go towards marketing and community building efforts.
