We've tried to make our finances as transparent as possible. Thus you can view our ledger of income and expenses on our [financials page](http://blog.engrxiv.org/financials/). Our regularly occurring monthly expenses total $4.61 which includes domain registrations and the SSL certificate, but does not include the service provided by the Center for Open Science/Open Science Framework, approximately $6000 per year. Income beyond these fixed costs would go towards marketing and community building efforts.
