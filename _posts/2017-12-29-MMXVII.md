2017 has been a great year here at engrXiv. After a [soft launch in mid-2016](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/07/announcement), the service [rolled out in full in December 2016](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/12/engrxiv-is-here). At time of writing, we have published 136 engineering articles that are free to read and download. Over the last year we have also implemented a number of new features including being [indexed by Google Scholar](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/04/google-scholar-indexing) and the [issuing of DOIs for all engrXiv submissions](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/07/DOIs-and-URLs). There is more to come in 2018! Coming shortly, be on the lookout for enhancements to article level analytics and metadata options. A little further down the road we are looking to implement a commenting system.

It is becoming increasingly common that [publishers are open to the posting of preprints prior to publication](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005473#sec008) and often there are provisions for posting the author version of a manuscript after publication as well. While [some publisher's policies could use greater clarity](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/07/open-letter-ASME), we expect to see greater improvement in this area through 2018 as authors push for more control over their scholarship and retention of more of their rights.

Currently [only ~17% of published work in engineering is openly accessible](https://www.authorea.com/users/102408/articles/212027-open-in-order-to-open-engineering). With your help, let's make 2018 the year that open scholarship in engineering really takes off!
