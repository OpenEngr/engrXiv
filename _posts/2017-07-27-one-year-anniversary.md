Today we celebrate the 1 year anniversary :tada: :birthday: :tada: of the [launch of engrXiv](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/07/announcement). In the last year, you all have posted over 120 eprints to engrXiv. During this time, we have also [partnered with Overleaf](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/09/author-overleaf-submit-engrxiv) where you can author and submit ([an engrXiv template is also available on Overleaf](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/02/template-available)), gotten [eprints on engrXiv indexed by Google Scholar](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/04/google-scholar-indexing), and begun [assigning DOIs for all submitted eprints](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/07/DOIs-and-URLs). We think the next year will be even bigger and we are glad you're here with us!
