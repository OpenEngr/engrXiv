We are well into 2019 now and the rate of submission to Engineering Archive continues to increase (check out our [stats](https://blog.engrxiv.org/stats/)!). With this increased submission rate, we have also seen an increase in spam. We try to catch these as quickly as possible and remove them, but using a post-moderation process means that the spam gets shared publicly on our social media accounts before being caught. Therefore, to help mitigate this, we will be shifting Engineering Archive to a pre-moderation process. This means that all submissions will be reviewed prior to being publicly shared. This will result in a small delay between submission and public availability/social media sharing, but we will work to keep this delay to a minimum.

At the same time, we are rolling out a new feature which will allow authors to request withdrawal of posted preprints. While we expect these requests to be rare, there are circumstances where it is appropriate to take down a preprint in order to comply with copyright policies and other requirements. When the request is made, authors will be asked to provide a reason for the withdrawal which will be reviewed by a moderator. Once the withdrawal is processed, the preprint file will be removed and it will be replaced with a page containing the title, authors, and reason provided for withdrawal. This page will serve as a landing page for any future visitors looking for the preprint.

More information about this and other Engineering Archive policies can be found on our [guidelines page](https://blog.engrxiv.org/guidelines/) or our [FAQ page](https://blog.engrxiv.org/faq/). Happy preprinting!
