In exciting news over the weekend, engrXiv is now being indexed in Google Scholar! A big thank you to the team at the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/) for all their hard work in collaborating with the Google Scholar developers to bring this feature online. This is a great step in getting engrXiv preprints recognized in the scholarly community and for rapid dissemination of our work and its connection to the broader body of knowledge.

Check back here for more developments arriving in the coming months!
