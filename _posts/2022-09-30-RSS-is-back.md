When [Google killed Google Reader](https://killedbygoogle.com/) back in 2013, many saw it as the beginning of the end for RSS feeds on the web. In many cases, those predictions have come true as most people consume their web content primarily through various private channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. But we at engrXiv are not ready to give up on RSS just yet! If you visit the [engrXiv homepage](https://www.engrxiv.org) today, you'll see new links in the right column for our RSS feeds. Subscribe to one of these feeds and you can receive and you can receive updates of new preprints posted to engrXiv delivered right to your favorite feed reader. Now that's convenient!

Of course, if you are no longer regularly using an RSS feed these days, our RSS feeds also provide the backend to all of the other venues you may visit to obtain your regular dose of new engineering research. These options include: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/engrxiv), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/engrXiv/), [Mastodon](https://scicomm.xyz/@engrxiv), and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#engrXiv-new-preprints:matrix.org).
