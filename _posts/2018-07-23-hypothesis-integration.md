Engineering Archive is now integrated with [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/), a third-party annotation tool that allows you to annotate preprints and provide feedback to the authors. The partnership builds on the foundations laid by the publication of [web annotation as a standard](https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/) by the W3C, the pioneering work by Hypothesis to build an open annotation infrastructure and by COS to offer OSF as a comprehensive platform for open scientific research and publication.

Once you set up a Hypothesis account, you can read, create, and reply to annotations and page notes through a simple interface directly over the preprint file itself. Readers will be able to make public annotations, private notes, or create collaboration groups. Annotation on preprints will increase transparency in scientific practices by enabling researchers to collaborate, discuss research with peers, and share additional information directly on preprints both before and after they are posted. We think this will be a useful tool to help gather early informal feedback prior to publication. This early feedback is one of the real strengths of preprints! 

You can see an example of Hypothesis annotation on [this preprint](https://engrxiv.org/k7fgk).
