The workflow for creating a new version of a preprint on Engineering Archive has been a challenge for the last year and a half as there was no mechanism for authors to submit new preprint versions and instead they had to manually notify the server administrator when the new versions were ready to be posted. As of a few weeks ago, this is no longer the case with the development of a new version submission workflow.

Thanks to [the work of Lepidus Technologia](https://github.com/lepidus/authorVersion), funded by [Open Engineering](https://www.openengr.com/2023/09/21/improving-the-submission-editing-workflow-in-ops/), authors can now submit new preprint versions when they are ready for them to be posted. As part of the workflow, authors are also asked to provide a justification for the new version, which will be shared with the server administrator and also displayed publicly on the preprint's page.

Instructions for following this new workflow can be found on the [Submission Editing](https://engrxiv.org/submission-editing) page.
