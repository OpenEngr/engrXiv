Engineering Archive is excited to announce that the server has moved from to a new hosting provider and server platform, [Open Preprint Systems (OPS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ops/) hosted by [PKP Publishing Services (PKP&#124;PS)](https://pkpservices.sfu.ca/).

Engineering Archive was launched in 2016 on the Open Science Framework (Center for Open Science). For the past five and a half years, we have seen strong growth of the server as an open access repository for engineering scholarship. We are grateful to the Center for Open Science for providing a home for the server in these first years of service.

Our new home with PKP&#124;PS will provide Engineering Archive with greater financial security and improved user management and unites us with the vibrant open-source community developing OPS (built on the same framework as the popular Open Journal Systems software). We must also thank the staff at PKP for their assistance in preparing the server for migration to this new platform.

We hope that you'll continue to read the work posted on engrXiv and share your own scholarship with us to make it freely accessible to anyone, anywhere.
