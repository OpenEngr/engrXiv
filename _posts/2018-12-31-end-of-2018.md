At the end of 2017 there were [136 articles posted on engrXiv](http://blog.engrxiv.org/2017/12/MMXVII). As we close out 2018, [engrXiv is now hosting 366 articles](https://engrxiv.org/discover) with more being uploaded all the time. This means that more articles were posted in 2018 (230 in total) than in the entire previous existence of the archive!

Growth of the submission rate continues to be strong and we expect this growth to continue into 2019.

This year we also [added hypothesis integration to engrXiv](https://blog.engrxiv.org/2018/07/hypothesis-integration) which allows for the addition of comments and annotation directly on preprint files using the W3C web standard protocol for annotation. We also saw a small change to how supplemental files are surfaces on preprint pages. The link is now displayed right at the top of the page, making it easier for visitors to your preprint page to find additional files associated with the preprint. This link takes visitors to the OSF project page associated with the preprint if the project page exists.

On the horizon, we expect to launch the display of view counts on preprint pages in 2019Q1. This metric is widely used to demonstrate impact of a work alongside download counts.

We hope you'll join us in continuing to grow engrXiv in 2019 and make more of our engineering scholarship accessible and available to all! As always, in addition to posting your work, you can help contribute to the development and growth of engrXiv through one-time or monthly donations. See our [donation page](https://blog.engrxiv.org/donate/) for the various ways in which you can make a financial contribution.
