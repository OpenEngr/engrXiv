About [this time last year](https://blog.engrxiv.org/2020/12/done-with-2020) we were wrapping up 2020 and thinking maybe we'd be heading to a bright new post-COVID future... oh how naive we were!  So here we are at the at the end of 2021 and the future at time remains uncertain from a global health perspective. Over the last year, we've seen some engineering researchers [publishing on COVID-19](https://engrxiv.org/discover?q=tags%3A(COVID-19%20OR%20COVID%20OR%20COVID19)) on issues related to detection, masks, filtration, etc. 

We've ended the year with a grand total of 2061 preprints hosted on Engineering Archive, which includes 614 new preprints over the past year. This is down slightly from 2020 but we're OK with that. The pandemic has taken a toll on all of us and even engineering researchers/scholars deserve a break.

Preprint downloads have doubled in the last year from 620,000 at the end of 2020 to 1,221,897 cummulative downloads to date! This brings a lot of value to the engineering research community.

The maintenance and development of Engineering Archive continues to be supported through [Open Engineering](https://www.openengr.com/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization for the promotion of open practices in engineering in all forms. [Donations are welcome!](https://www.openengr.com/donate/)

We continue to appreciate the support of the [Engineering Archive Membership Circle](https://blog.engrxiv.org/membership-circle/). The Membership Circle creates the opportunity for institutions, libraries, and other organizations to support the sustainability of the server through a $500 annual contribution. We are especially grateful to those organizations who have newly joined in 2021, [West Virginia University Libraries](https://library.wvu.edu/) and [TU Delft Open Publishing](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/os/open-publishing)! Of course this doesn't make us appreciate our sustaining members any less, some of which have been supporting Engineering Archive for three years!

Interested individuals can reach out to [info@engrxiv.org](mailto:info@engrxiv.org) to learn more or to request to join the Membership Circle. 

**HAPPY NEW YEAR** to all Engineering Archive researchers, readers, institutional supporters, donors, and other users. We have some big things coming in 2022, some of which we will be able to announce shortly so stay tuned!
