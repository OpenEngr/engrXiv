**Update:** We have [announced](https://blog.engrxiv.org/2022/01/announcing-engrxiv-new-host) that the migration of the server to its new host has been completed. Legacy authors can read more about how this migration affects them [here](https://blog.engrxiv.org/2022/01/legacy-author-migration).
<hr/>

This post is to announce that Engineering Archive will be closed to new preprint submissions starting at approximately 4pm CST on Wednesday, January 19th. We expect this submission downtime to last approximately one week. This downtime will not impact the accessibility of existing preprints on the server.
