According to [our stats](https://blog.engrxiv.org/stats/), engrXiv has surpassed 1,000,000 downloads of the content we host! This represents a significant savings to the engineering research community. If each of those downloads represented a purchase of a paywalled article, that would be around $25,000,000 saved.
