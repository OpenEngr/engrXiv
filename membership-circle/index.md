## Join the Membership Circle
The Engineering Archive Membership Circle is for institutions or organizations interested in supporting open dissemination of engineering scholarship. The annual membership fee is $500.00 which helps cover the expenses of operating the server, including developer maintenance, DOI minting, hosting, overhead, domain registrations, and marketing. 

**What you get:** we will feature your organization on our website and social media channels (unless you ask us not to).

Those interested in joining the Membership Circle should email [info@engrxiv.org](mailto:info@engrxiv.org).
