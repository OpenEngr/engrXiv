## Join the Membership Circle
The Engineering Archive Membership Circle is for institutions or organizations interested in supporting open dissemination of engineering scholarship. All that we ask is for an annual payment of $500.00 which helps cover the expenses of operating the server, including developer maintenance, DOI minting, hosting, overhead, domain registrations, and marketing. 

**What you get:** our acknowledgement of your organization as a supporter on our website and social media channels (unless you ask us not to).

Those interested in joining the Membership Circle should email [info@engrxiv.org](mailto:info@engrxiv.org).

<sub>Note: From a legal and administrative perspective, we are not a membership based organization and joining the Membership Circle does not convey any voting rights within the organization.</sub>
